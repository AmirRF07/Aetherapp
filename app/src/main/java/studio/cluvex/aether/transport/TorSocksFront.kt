/**
 * The SOCKS5 server tun2socks talks to whenever the device's traffic leaves
 * through Tor (`Tor` and `Aether -> Tor`).
 *
 * ## Why this class has to exist, and why 1.2.7 removed Tor without it
 *
 * Tor carries **TCP only**. There is no UDP in Tor, in any implementation,
 * including arti - it is a property of the protocol, not of the software. The
 * forwarder this app ships is **hev-socks5-tunnel**, configured with
 * `udp: 'udp'`, so it hands every UDP flow the device produces to the SOCKS5
 * proxy as `UDP ASSOCIATE` (command `0x03`). A Tor SOCKS proxy answers
 * `CONNECT` (`0x01`) and refuses that command.
 *
 * Every DNS query on Android is UDP. So pointing tun2socks straight at the
 * engine's Tor listener produces the exact failure this project has already
 * shipped once and diagnosed at length for Psiphon (see [PsiphonSocksFront]):
 * a tunnel that establishes, reports a healthy Tor exit, passes the self-test -
 * because the self-test resolves through a `CONNECT` with a HOSTNAME - and opens
 * not one page, because name resolution never had a path at all.
 *
 * ## What this does instead
 *
 * ```
 *   hev ──CONNECT <host|ip:port>──► relayed to Tor's SOCKS5, hostname INTACT
 *       └─UDP ASSOCIATE──► answered HERE:
 *             a DNS query  -> resolved over TCP *inside Tor* and answered
 *             anything else-> dropped, counted, reported once
 * ```
 *
 * Three details matter more than the plumbing:
 *
 * 1. **A hostname is never resolved locally.** `ATYP=DOMAIN` is passed to Tor
 *    verbatim so the name is resolved at the exit. That is what keeps DNS off
 *    the local network entirely and what makes `.onion` addresses work at all -
 *    resolving them here would be impossible and leaking them to the operator's
 *    resolver would be worse.
 * 2. **DNS is answered over TCP through Tor**, by opening a `CONNECT` to a
 *    resolver's TCP/53 through Tor and framing the query with the standard
 *    two-byte length prefix (RFC 1035 §4.2.2). The answer comes back through the
 *    same circuit as everything else, so the resolver a censor can see is Tor's
 *    exit, not the phone.
 * 3. **Non-DNS UDP is dropped, loudly.** QUIC (UDP/443) is the common case, and
 *    a browser that gets no answer on QUIC falls back to TCP within a second, so
 *    dropping is the correct behaviour rather than a lie. It is counted and
 *    surfaced in [dropSummary] so a slow-video report can be explained instead
 *    of guessed at.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to the network directly. Every byte goes through the SOCKS5
 * proxy given to [start], which is the engine's Tor listener - port 1819 in
 * `--tor-only` mode, 1820 when Tor rides inside the tunnel.
