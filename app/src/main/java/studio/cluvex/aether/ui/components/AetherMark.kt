/**
 * The connected mark: Aether's own **A**, alive.
 *
 * ## Why this replaces the tick
 *
 * The tick said "done". It is the glyph a form uses when it accepts an email
 * address, it is the glyph every other app on the phone uses for the same thing,
 * and it says nothing about *which* tunnel is up. The mark that belongs on this
 * button once the tunnel carries traffic is the app's own: the same A that is on
 * the launcher icon, in the notification, and on the release page. Connected now
 * shows you the product, not a checkbox.
 *
 * ## It is the launcher icon, to the coordinate
 *
 * The geometry in [MARK_OUTLINE] and [MARK_COUNTER] is lifted verbatim from
 * `res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml` - the chevron A with the small
 * triangular counter under its apex - and mapped into whatever box the caller
 * gives it. Nothing here is a new letterform: if the icon is ever redrawn, these
 * two coordinate lists are the only thing that has to follow, and the animation
 * rides on top unchanged.
 *
 * ## What moves, and why it is not decoration
 *
 * Four independent animations, all of them cheap, each doing one job:
 *
 *  * **Colour cycle** - the mark drifts continuously through the app's accent ramp
 *    (mint, cyan, azure, violet, orchid, amber) instead of holding one hue. It is
 *    the same idea as the connection card's travelling edge, so the two read as one
 *    living surface rather than two light shows competing, and a glance at the
 *    button tells you it is live *now* and not a frozen "connected" state from
 *    twenty minutes ago.
 *  * **Light sweep** - a soft diagonal highlight crossing the glyph. This is what
 *    makes the A read as a physical, polished object catching light rather than a
 *    flat fill.
 *  * **Scan bar + hairlines** - a bright bar travelling up the inside of the letter
 *    over a faint static hairline grid: the visual language of something being
 *    *inspected and verified*, which is precisely what the tunnel is doing while
 *    this glyph is on screen.
 *  * **Reveal** - a single bottom-to-top wipe with a bright construction line at
 *    its edge, played once, when the mark appears. Connection is an event and it
 *    deserves one; a mark that faded in like a tooltip would waste it.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * Same discipline as [GlowCycle], for the same reason - this runs on a phone that
 * is also encrypting every packet on the device:
 *
 *  * the whole thing is ONE `Canvas` and five `animateFloat`s;
 *  * every animated value is read INSIDE the draw lambda, so a frame costs a
 *    redraw and never a recomposition;
 *  * the caller composes this only while connected (see [ConnectButton]), so a
 *    disconnected screen subscribes to no frame callbacks at all;
 *  * the two paths are scratch objects that are `reset()` and refilled per frame -
 *    a dozen `lineTo` calls, no allocation - so a size change needs no cache
 *    invalidation logic to get wrong;
 *  * the bloom is additive strokes, not a blur pass and not an extra layer.
