/**
 * Answers one question, before anything else is worth asking: **is the build in
 * front of me the build I think it is?**
 *
 * ## Why this exists (1.2.8-r5)
 *
 * Rounds r2, r3 and r4 all shipped as `versionName "1.2.8"`, `versionCode 12`,
 * and the engine's own banner printed only the upstream core version
 * (`Aether v1.8.0`) which is byte-identical in all three. There was therefore no
 * way - in the UI, in the exported log, or on the releases page - to tell an APK
 * from two rounds ago apart from today's.
 *
 * The r4 field log is the receipt for what that costs. Five independent strings
 * in it belong to the **r3** engine and Kotlin:
 *
 *  1. `netstack buffers=512KB/128KB` - r4 rewrote that line to
 *     `netstack tcp tx/rx=...KB/...KB (rx = advertised window)`.
 *  2. Not one `[netstack]` telemetry line in six minutes - r4 emits one every
 *     15 s, so roughly two dozen were due.
 *  3. `Latency probe failed (viaTunnel=true): 9.9.9.9:443 Connect timed out` -
 *     r4's [PingMonitor] cannot produce that wording; it reports
 *     `dial failed` / `no answer on an established session` and logs
 *     `Warm latency session up via ...` on success.
 *  4. 260 raw `updated server` notices - r4's Psiphon noise filter collapses
 *     those into one `(+N routine server-list notices suppressed)` line.
 *  5. The cached 396 ms endpoint rejected and a 475 ms one accepted 2 ms later -
 *     the contradiction r4's scan quality gate was written to remove.
 *
 * A whole diagnosis round was spent on a binary that predates the fix under
 * test. No amount of care prevents that; it is a missing build identity. So the
 * identity now exists and it is checked at both ends:
 *
 *  * the APK's own patch level is `BuildConfig.PATCH_LEVEL`, read from the
 *    repo-root `PATCHLEVEL` file at compile time;
 *  * the engine stamps the same value into `libaether.so` (see `build.rs`) and
 *    prints it as its second stdout line;
 *  * `scripts/build-natives.sh` greps the stripped `.so` for it and CI greps it
 *    again inside the packaged APK, so a stale engine cannot be released;
 *  * and [ingest] below compares the two AT RUNTIME and shouts if they differ.
 *
 * The practical upshot for whoever reads the next field log: the answer to "am I
 * even testing the right build?" is on line two, every time, and a mismatch is a
 * `W/build` line that cannot be missed.
