/**
 * The one network path the AI layer is allowed to use: HTTPS to Google, dialled
 * through the tunnel's own local SOCKS5 proxy.
 *
 * ## Why this is hand-rolled instead of `HttpsURLConnection`
 *
 * Three reasons, in order of how badly each one would bite:
 *
 *  1. **Our own sockets bypass the tunnel.** The VpnService excludes this app's
 *     package from the VPN on purpose, so a stock HTTP client would leave on the
 *     operator's network however connected the phone looks. See [AiGate].
 *  2. **`Proxy(SOCKS)` resolves DNS locally.** `java.net.Proxy` with a SOCKS
 *     address hands the proxy an already-resolved IP, so the device would have to
 *     resolve `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` itself, on the operator's
 *     resolver, off-tunnel - a DNS query that both fails and advertises intent.
 *     A hand-written SOCKS5 CONNECT can send the destination as a DOMAIN
 *     (`ATYP=0x03`) and let the exit resolve it, which is what a browser tab
 *     inside the tunnel does. This is the same technique, and the same reasoning,
 *     as [studio.cluvex.aether.core.NetProbe].
 *  3. **No new dependency.** The app ships no HTTP library, and adding OkHttp for
 *     one endpoint would grow the APK for something ~200 lines already do.
 *
 * TLS is terminated on the device, over the proxied socket, with hostname
 * verification enforced explicitly (see [tlsWrap]) - so neither the operator nor
 * the exit node can read or alter the conversation, and the API key is protected
 * end-to-end.
