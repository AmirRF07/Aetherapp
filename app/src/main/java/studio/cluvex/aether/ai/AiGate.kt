/**
 * Why the AI is or is not available right now.
 *
 * ## The whole reason this file exists
 *
 * `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` is not reachable from Iran, and it is not
 * reachable from this app by accident either: [studio.cluvex.aether.vpn.AetherVpnService]
 * calls `addDisallowedApplication` on our own package, so Aether's own sockets
 * DELIBERATELY bypass the tunnel it is building. A plain `HttpsURLConnection` to
 * Google from inside this app therefore leaves on the operator's network, in the
 * clear, and fails - and on the way it announces to the operator that this device
 * just tried to reach a blocked AI endpoint.
 *
 * So every AI request in this app is dialled through the tunnel's own local
 * SOCKS5 proxy, and the AI is only offered when there IS a tunnel to dial
 * through. That is not a policy decision that could be relaxed later: with the
 * tunnel down there is no path to Google at all.
 *
 * The mode requirement is the second half of the same fact. Plain `Aether` exits
 * through a Cloudflare WARP address, and Google's AI endpoints refuse or
 * challenge those - which is exactly the symptom 1.2.8 shipped release notes
 * about ("Gemini, ChatGPT and similar AI apps sometimes said there was no
 * internet connection"). The chained `Aether -> Psiphon` mode exits through a
 * Psiphon address instead, which those endpoints accept. Anything else would put
 * a feature in the app that fails for everyone who tries it, which is the mistake
 * the retired single-hop Psiphon backend already taught this project once (see
 * [TransportBackend]).
