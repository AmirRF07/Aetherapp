# Purge sources that 1.2.2 removed but that still exist in an older checkout.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# 1.2.2 deleted several source files (the in-app updater, the country/location
# picker, the forced-exit policy). When the new sources are copied on top of an
# existing 1.2.1 repository, *added and changed* files are overwritten but the
# *deleted* ones stay behind. Those orphans still reference symbols and string
# resources that no longer exist, so the Kotlin compiler fails with a wall of
# "Unresolved reference" errors (UpdateChecker.kt -> GITHUB_REPO,
# UpdatePrompt.kt -> update_available, ...) even though the shipped source tree
# compiles perfectly on its own. That is exactly why the same sources built
# fine in a fresh repository and failed in the 1.2.1 one.
#
# The build now removes those orphans itself before compiling, so the release
# pipeline can never be broken again by a leftover file from an older version.
#
# Safety: only paths listed in .github/removed-sources.txt are ever touched,
# and only inside app/ , native/aether/aether/src/ , docs/ and scripts/ .

			# that with transport/TorSocksFront.kt, because Tor moved into the

			# that belongs to the release, the commit step pushes the deletion
			# to the branch, and the build fails with "Unresolved reference" in
